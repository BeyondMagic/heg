# Harmomonia e Guerra (HeG)

A game where a group of players are presented, one by one, with a list of scrambled numbers and must then sort it as efficiently as possible, counting time, and of course, the number of inversions needed to get there, as their points are calculated this way.

Several rounds with different difficulties can be used.

In addition, the game has been gamified so that players can learn more about musical notes!

Sorting numbers is like tuning a chaotic orchestra to a harmonious symphony!!
